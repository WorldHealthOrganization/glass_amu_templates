The **WHO GLASS NAMU Template** is a tool developed by the **World Health Organization (WHO)** to support the measurement and analysis of **antimicrobial use (AMU)** at national level.

## Overview

This tool is designed to:

- Facilitate the collection of AMU data at the **product level** accordingly to the [**WHO GLASS methodology for surveillance of national antimicrobial consumption**](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240012639)
- Enable calculation of AMU data at the **substance level** using **Defined Daily Doses (DDD)**
- Provide basic analytics capabilities, including classification of AMU data according to:
  - **AWaRe** (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification
  - **ATC** (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) classification
- **Export** the calculated AMU data for **further analysis**
- **Export** the collected AMU data into the GLASS format for **submission to WHO** (only for GLASS NAMU National Focal Points)

## National AMU Tool

The template is made of 4 parts:
- Information and legal mentions (worksheet _WHO Template_)
- Calculation and export functionalities (worksheet _Macro_)
- Data entry (worksheets _'Availability Data', 'Population Data', 'Product Data'_)
